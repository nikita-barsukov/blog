There is a lot of attention to income distribution and income inequality among parts of country. It is known fact to people who are obsessed wiht charts that richest parst of the US are Silicon valley in the East Cosast, and the poorest are South and Midwest.

I on the other side was extremely interested in figuring out how income is distributed within Denmark. Danish statistical body has nicely formatted data on its site, so I constructed a cholopleth chart with median household income by Danish kommune between 2000 -- 2012. This income is __after__ tax.

Needless to say, pattern is very different from the US. Surprizingly, it supports some of the common tropes about Scandinavian countries. 

* No areas in Denmark with average income significantly less than nation average;
* There was steady growth in household income in every kommune for all the years, except 2008;
* Income decline in 2008 was especially sharp in the rich areas while the rest of Denmark it was relatively mild;
* Household income varies little among kommunes, with exception of an area to the north of Denmark;
* Danish wealthy leave almost exclusively in the area to the north of Copenhagen;
