Danish statistical body has nicely formatted data on its site. I constructed a cholopleth chart with median household income by Danish kommune between 2000 -- 2012. This income is __after__ tax.

<div id="disposable-income"></div>

This map, surprizingly, supports some of the common tropes about Scandinavian countries. 

* No areas in Denmark with average income significantly less than nation average;
* There was steady growth in household income in every kommune for all the years, except 2008;
* Income decline in 2008 was especially sharp in the rich areas while the rest of Denmark it was relatively mild;
* Household income varies little among kommunes, with exception of an area to the north of Denmark;
* Danish wealthy leave almost exclusively in the area to the north of Copenhagen;
