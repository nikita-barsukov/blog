      <p>A while ago I posted <a href="/income"> a map</a> of average yearly income in Danish municipalities. I put a lot of effort to create that map, but after some time I realized that not just my code was a big mess, but visualisation itself can be improved a great deal. So I sat down, took a new dataset from Danish statistics site, and rewrote the whole visualization.</p>

      <p>This viz reflects following key points:

      <ul>
        <li>Danish wealthy leave almost exclusively in the area to the north of Copenhagen. Wealth in other parts of Denmark is distributed remarkably evenly;</li>
        <li>No areas in Denmark with average income significantly less than nation average;</li>
        <li>There was a decline in national income in 2008, especially in the rich areas;</li>
      </ul></p>
