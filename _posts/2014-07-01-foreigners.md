Statistics about foreigners in Denmark is available in multiple places on the internet. Official state portal for foreigners moving to Denmark publishes [yearly reports](http://www.nyidanmark.dk/da-dk/Statistik/SearchStatistics.htm?searchtype=statistics) on foreigners in Denmark, while Danish statistical agency has a [whole section](http://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/emner/indvandrere-og-efterkommere.aspx) on its site that is dedicated to statistics about those who were born outside Denmark but live in it.

One common thing that is reflected in publications on both places is that share of foreign-born Danish residents is steadily rising during last fifteen years.

However there is one thing that is missing from these reports. It would be interesting to see which parts of Denmark have higher share of foreigners.

The pattern is not very surprising. Kommunes with larger cities, like Odense, Aalborg and of course Copenhagen have larger share of foreigners than rural kommunes in Jylland or Sjælland. However the largest share of foreigners has a small kommune of Ishøj to the west from Copenhagen: 17%, Copenhagen comes second and another kommune to the west from Copenhagen, Albertslund is a third with 13.5% of foreigners among its residents. A bit surprising is that an anclave within Copenhagen, Fredriksberg, has significantly lower share of foreigners, 11%.
